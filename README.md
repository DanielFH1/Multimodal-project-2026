# Multimodal AI & Robotics Portfolio (2026)

This repository contains a collection of projects focusing on Multimodal Sensor Fusion and Autonomous Systems.

## 📂 Project List

### 1. **[Project 1: Multimodal Localization System](./Project1_SensorFusion)** 

- **Summary**: Developed a comprehensive state estimation framework that fuses **Vision (AprilTag)**, **LiDAR (ICP-matching)**, and **IMU (Inertial)** data to achieve robust robot localization.
- **Tech Stack**: Built with **Python**, **NumPy**, and **SciPy** for high-performance matrix operations and **Matplotlib** for real-time data visualization.
- **Technical Impact**: Implemented **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** to handle non-linear kinematics and **Particle Filter** to manage non-Gaussian noise, successfully recovering ground-truth trajectories from high-noise environments.
- **Key Insight**: Demonstrated the conceptual synergy between robotic sensor fusion and **Multimodal AI's context-awareness**, proving that integrating complementary data sources significantly enhances system reliability and precision.
